# Project One - Tetris

# Project Brief

For my first project at General Assembly, I had one week to make a grid-based game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, choosing from a list of nine provided. I opted for Tetris, which was apparently one of the most challenging games on the list; but I always enjoy a good challenge.

Overview and Concept:

Apart from the level of challenge, another motivator for building this game was that I had a clear concept of the feel and styling of the game from the outset, which gave Tetris an advantage over many of the other options. I wanted a very strong Soviet, brutalist aesthetic, complete with a reel-to-reel camera feel, plenty of grey, red and gold, and some Shostakovich accompanying the gameplay. From a gameplay perspective, I wanted to have the requisite seven individually coloured, rotatable, moveable tetriminoes (as the shapes in Tetris are apparently called!) descending on an 11x20 grid, with an imperceptible increase in speed as the playing continues - the idea being that the user would be slow to notice that the game was getting steadily harder.  The userâ€™s score would have to be logged on a scoreboard, and should update with every row cleared - updating exponentially, as there is a bonus for clearing four rows simultaneously, and another bonus for doing this on consecutive clearings.
